## General info

<details>
<summary>Click here to see general information about <b>Cipher Project</b>!</summary>
<b>Cipher project</b> provides two simple ciphers:
<ul>
<li> <b>ROT13</b>: A Caesar cipher that shifts each letter by 13 places.</li>
<li> <b>ROT47</b>: More complex cipher that shifts ASCII characters by 47 places.</li>
</ul>
Both ciphers provides features like encrypt and decrypt.
Moreover, this app provides displaying data, reading from file, saving to file and deleting data.
