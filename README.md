## 📝 Introduction

This project provides two simple ciphers:
- **ROT13**: A Caesar cipher that shifts each letter by 13 places.
- **ROT47**: A more complex cipher that shifts ASCII characters by 47 places.

Both ciphers are simple substitution ciphers, but they offer a basic level of obfuscation suitable for educational purposes and simple encoding tasks.

## ✨ Features
- Encode and decode text using ROT13.
- Encode and decode text using ROT47.
